# Guessing_game
This is a guessing game written in Python. The game generates a random number between 0 and 100 and the user has to guess the number. The program will tell the user if their guess is too high or too low and will keep track of the guesses. If the user guesses the correct number, the program will print “You guessed the correct number”.
